# HugData Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of HugData, a Laravel + React reimplementation of the WrenAI GenBI Agent, designed to avoid AGPL licensing obligations.

## Project Structure
```

â”œâ”€â”€ hugdata-app/          # Laravel backend (this repository)
â”œâ”€â”€ hugdata-ai/           # Python AI services (separate repository)  
â”œâ”€â”€ HugData_Implementation_Plan.md     # Detailed implementation plan
â”œâ”€â”€ WrenAI_Technical_Report.md         # Technical analysis of WrenAI

## Implementation Status

### Planning Phase âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] WrenAI technical analysis and architecture review
- [x] Implementation plan documentation
- [x] Project structure definition
- [x] Technology stack selection

### Phase 1: Foundation ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Laravel application setup with authentication
- [ ] Database connection management system
- [ ] Basic React frontend with routing
- [ ] Python AI service skeleton (separate repo)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup

### Phase 2: Core Query Engine ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- [ ] Text-to-SQL implementation
- [ ] Query execution engine  
- [ ] Basic result visualization
- [ ] Schema introspection
- [ ] Error handling and validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- [ ] Chart generation and visualization

## Next Steps
1. Complete database connection management system
2. Set up Python AI service repository at `/Users/raulmata/Projetos/Hug/Company/SQL/hugdata-ai`
3. Implement basic React frontend structure
4. Establish communication between Laravel and Python services

## Key Implementation Notes
- **Clean Room Development**: No direct code copying from AGPL WrenAI sources
- **Licensing**: Laravel (MIT) + React frontend, separate Python AI services
- **Architecture**: Microservices approach with clear separation of concerns
- **Commercial Viability**: Free from AGPL restrictions for commercial use

## Current Sprint Focus
Setting up foundational infrastructure and basic Laravel application structure before implementing core AI functionality.
